## Overview

ZedCraft is a project developed as part of CPRE 488, also known as "Embedded Systems Design," where we aim to run a Minecraft server on a ZedBoard FPGA. The project integrates various peripherals, including a camera and a turret, to enable interaction with the Minecraft environment through plugins and C programs.

## Features

- Run a Minecraft server on a ZedBoard FPGA.
- Integrate a camera for in-game visuals.
- Connect a turret for interactive gameplay.
- Develop Minecraft plugins and C programs for peripheral interaction.
- Explore the possibilities of embedded systems in gaming environments.
